            <p>
              I'm Vanna Moore, a recent graduate with a degree in Information Technology. I specialize in app development and software engineering, with experience in React, TypeScript, and backend scripting.
            </p>
            <p>
              I enjoy solving problems, building useful tools, and continuously learning new things. Whether it's deploying a web app or tailoring a pair of jeans (yes, I sew too), I'm all about combining logic with creativity.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I’m not coding, I’m probably exploring new tech, improving my workflow, or refining this portfolio right here.
