        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          I'm a recent graduate with a bachelor's degree in Information
          Technology, now focused on app development and software engineering.
          I’ve worked with React, TypeScript, and backend scripting, but I’m
          also re-grounding myself in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to stay sharp.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy solving problems, building useful tools, and continuously
          learning new things. Whether it's deploying a web app or tailoring a
          pair of jeans (yes, I sew too), I'm all about combining logic with
          creativity.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I’m not coding, I’m probably exploring new tech, improving my
          workflow, or refining my portfolio right here.
